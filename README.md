# Visionary Hackathon - GeoAR

## Problem Statment
Geography is a foundational topic that introduces students to the physical, environmental, and cultural characteristics of different places around the world. Despite its inclusion in most school curriculums, many students struggle to fully grasp and retain geographical concepts, often due to a lack of immersive, engaging learning resources. The traditional methods of teaching geography rarely allow students to interact with or visualize the places they learn about, making it harder for them to relate to and understand the diverse landscapes, climates, and cultures across regions.

## Proposed Solution:
This gap underscores the need for innovative educational tools. An augmented reality (AR) application focused on geography could bring the world directly to students’ fingertips, offering interactive, visual aids that make learning about any location—from topography to cultural landmarks—engaging and memorable. Such an app would empower students to explore the intricacies of Indian geography in an immersive way, potentially transforming their comprehension and interest in the subject.
